Program Name:

Program Description:
Have you played rock, paper, scissors before? If not, here are the rules! A player and the computer will choose either rock, paper, or scissors. To determine the winner, rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. If they choose the same item, it is a tie!



Generate a random number 0 to 2 for the computerâ€™s play. 0 = Rock, 1 = Paper, 2 = Scissors. Seed the random number generator prior to generating the number.

Prompt the user for their name as a string. Their name may include spaces.

Prompt the user for their play as a char. Valid inputs are R, P, or S, case insensitive (r, p, s must also work).

If the user enters an invalid play, print an error and end the game.

If a valid play is entered, determine the winner (see above). Hint: You may want to convert the computer play to R, P, or S for comparing.

Design:
A. INPUT
string name = ""; 
char userPlay = '\0';

B. OUTPUT
char computerPlay = '\0';

C. CALCULATIONS
computerPlay = RANDOM IN ('r', 'p', 's')

enum {TIE = 0, USER_WIN = 1, COMPUTER_WIN = 2};
int gameStatus = TIE; 

IF computerPlay == userPlay 
    gameStatus = TIE;
ELSE IF computerPlay == 'r' 
    gameStatus = userPlay == 'p' ? USER_WIN : COMPUTER_WIN;
ELSE IF computerPlay == 'p'
    gameStatus = userPlay == 's' ? USER_WIN : COMPUTER_WIN;
ELSE COMPUTER PLAY IS 's'
    gameStatus = userPlay == 'r' ? USER_WIN : COMPUTER_WIN;
